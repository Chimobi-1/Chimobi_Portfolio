The goal of this project is to check the your ability to work with, manipulate and aggregate data.
It´s your first day in a Data Science advisory firm and your boss asks you to produce the official Summer Olympic Games Medal Tables for all Editions from 1896 to 2012.
All you can use is a dataset with raw data containing over 31,000 medals (summer.csv) and the official Medal Tables for the Editions 1996 and 1976 from Wikipedia. (wik_1996.csv, wik_1976.csv). Use the two official Medal Tables as a reference to check whether your code produces the correct output!

Your goal is to minimize the divergence between your aggregated Medal Tables and the official Medal Tables. Let´s assume that the official number of Gold Medals for the United States in the Edition 1996 is 44 and your code produces 46. This is an absolute divergence of 2.

Calculate the total absolute divergence for the Editions 1996 and 1976 (the "Score")! The optimal Score is 0!
